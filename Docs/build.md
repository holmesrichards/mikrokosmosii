# Microkosmos II build notes

This is a very simple and straightforward build. Just a few special things to note:

Capacitor C3's value should be about 1/10 of the piezo capacitance. I measured the disks I got from Tayda at about 10 nF, so used 1 nF for C3.

The panel is double sided. One side allows mounting the module with the scratch area at the top and the jacks at the bottom. The other side allows vice versa. You might prefer the latter if you are mounting it down low with the patch cords heading upwards.

The piezo element should be attached to the back of the front panel, in the scratch area. I have used double stick adhesive strips successfully; hot glue may also work. *Check the panel orientation before attaching the piezo!* Then connect the black wire to the ground terminal of the input jack and the red wire to the tip switch terminal of the input jack. You may need to add extensions to these wires to get them to reach.

Before soldering the pot, attach it to the front panel loosely. Put the PCB onto the pot pins and attach it to the front panel with two 5 mm M3 spacers using four 6 mm M3 screws. Then solder the pot.
